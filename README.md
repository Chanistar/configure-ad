<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />



<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Creating and setting up the Virtual Machines.
- Testing and Observing connectivity.
- Installing Active Directory Domain Services. 
- Adding a client to the Domain.
- Allowing "domain users" access to Remote Desktop.

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

<p>

Create two Virtual Machines in the same Resourse Group, Network and Subnet:                                                                                                                                          
    One as a Server and One as a standard Virtual Machine to be a client.

  After the DC-VM is created, setting the Domain Controllerâ€™s NIC Private IP address to be static. A Domain Controller's IP address needs to be static to ensure other devices can consistently locate it for authentication and resource access. A dynamic IP could cause communication failures, disrupting domain services and network functionality.

After the Client VM is created, setting the Client-VM's DNS settings to the DC-VM's Private IP address.

   Disabling the Windows Firewall for testing connectivity in the DC-VM.

Observing the communication between the two virtual machines after pinging the DC-VM from the Client-VM.

 After running an ipconfig /all, we can see that the DNS Server's private IP address is now that of the DC-VM and not the usual Azure private IP address.

Installing Active Directory.
Active Directory (AD) is a directory service that stores and organizes network information like users, groups, and computers.

Creating a Forest in Active Directory. (A Forest is the top-level container that holds one or more domains, sharing a common schema and global catalog for centralized management and security.)

Setting up Remote Desktop for non-administrative users on the Client-VM.
