<h1>On-Prem Active Directory Implemented in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This guide outlines the installation and configuration of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />



<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Creating and setting up the Virtual Machines.
- Testing and Observing connectivity.
- Installing Active Directory Domain Services. 
- Adding clientele to the Domain.
- Allowing "domain users" access to Remote Desktop.
- Configuring Active Directory and Group Policy.

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

<p>

Create two Virtual Machines in the same resource group, Network, and Subnet:                                                                                                                                          
    One as a server, and one as a standard virtual machine used as a client.

After creating the DC-VM, the Domain Controllerâ€™s NIC private IP address is set to static. A Domain Controller's IP address must remain static to ensure that other devices can reliably locate it for authentication and resource access. A dynamic IP address could cause communication failures, interrupting domain services and network functionality.

After creating the Client-VM, configure its DNS settings to point to the DC-VM's Private IP address.

  Temporarily Disabling the Windows firewall to test connectivity in the DC-VM.

Observing the communication between the two virtual machines after pinging the DC-VM from the Client-VM.

 After running the command ipconfig /all, we can see that the DNS Server's private IP address is now that of the DC-VM and not the usual Azure private IP address.

Installing Active Directory.
Active Directory (AD) is a directory service that stores and organizes network information like users, groups, and computers.

Creating a forest in Active Directory. (A Forest is a top-level container that holds one or more domains, sharing a common schema and global catalog for centralized management and security.)

Joining the Client-VM to the Domain.

Setting up Remote Desktop for non-administrative users on the Client-VM.                                                                                                                                            
             Now, it is possible to log into the Client-VM as a normal, non-administrative user.
